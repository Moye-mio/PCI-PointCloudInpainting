# PCI
A method of point cloud inpainting by decomposing the representation of point cloud into low frequency signal and high frequency signal. <br>
The low frequency signal is constructed by fitting point clouds to nurbs using point-distance-minimization which is always complete, while the high frequency signal is constructed by distances from discrete points to nurbs which needs to be inpainted somewhere called hole.

# Contribution
- a complete pipeline to inpaint point clouds using nurbs and image inpainting tech.
- a method to define holes and detect holes automatically.
- haven't decided yet, hhh \_(:з」∠)\_

# Info
still developing...
